# One-Time-Password(OTP)

This is a project from my Operating Systems class. A message is passed via a socket to another process that encrypts the message with the key, and is passed back through the socket. The same process happens during decryption. There are 5 programs in total for key generation, message encryption (client and server), and message decryption(client and server).
